As a freshman in 1995, one of the Arizona Republican's first

Year Resignation Letter'' to the House clerk announcing that he

   A chronology of major world events in 1994
    PARIS, Jan 1 (AFP) - The advent of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and in 
Jericho, the signing of peace between Israel and Jordan, continuing war in 
Bosnia and escalating bloodshed in Algeria and Rwanda were among the major 
events that marked 1994.
    JANUARY
    - Jan 1-25 - MEXICO - Between 100 and 400 people died when Indians from 
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) stage an armed rebellion in 
Mexico's southern Chiapas state, one of the country's poorest regions. The 
rebels demanded free elections, help to combat poverty and the resignation of 
President Carlos Salinas. On June 12, EZLN fighters, after earlier talks, 
rejected government offers to end the revolt รง.
