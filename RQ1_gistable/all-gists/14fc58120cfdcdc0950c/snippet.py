"""
Script to sort edge list of a simple polygon with 1 face in Blender with Python.
Something like this:
      0_________3
      /         \
    4/           \2
     \           /
     5\_________/1
becomes sorted as {[4,5],[5,1],...,[0,4]}.
Tested with Blender v2.67.
##! Make sure to be in Edit Mode !##
